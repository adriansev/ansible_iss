# Define different modes for sending replies in response to received ARP requests that resolve local target IP addresses:
# 0 - (default): reply for any local target IP address, configured on any interface
# 1 - reply only if the target IP address is local address configured on the incoming interface
# 2 - reply only if the target IP address is local address configured on the incoming interface and both with the sender.s IP address are part from same subnet on this interface 3 - do not reply for local addresses configured with scope host, only resolutions for global and link addresses are replied
# 4-7 - reserved
# 8 - do not reply for all local addresses
