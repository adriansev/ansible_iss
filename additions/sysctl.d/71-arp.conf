# 2 - Loose mode as defined in RFC3704 Loose Reverse Path Each incoming packet.s source address is also tested against
#     the FIB and if the source address is not reachable via any interface the packet check will fail.

# 1 - Allows you to have multiple network interfaces on the same subnet, and have the ARPs for each interface
#     be answered based on whether or not the kernel would route a packet from the ARP'd IP out that interface
#     (therefore you must use source based routing for this to work).
#     In other words it allows control of which cards (usually 1) will respond to an arp request.
# 0 - (default) The kernel can respond to arp requests with addresses from other interfaces.
#     This may seem wrong but it usually makes sense, because it increases the chance of successful communication.
#     IP addresses are owned by the complete host on Linux, not by particular interfaces.
#     Only for more complex setups like load- balancing, does this behaviour cause problems.

# https://sysctl-explorer.net/net/ipv4/arp_announce/
# Define different restriction levels for announcing the local source IP address from IP packets in ARP requests sent on interface
# 0 - (default) Use any local address, configured on any interface
# 1 - Try to avoid local addresses that are not in the target's subnet for this interface.
#     This mode is useful when target hosts reachable via this interface require the source IP address
#     in ARP requests to be part of their logical network configured on the receiving interface.
#     When we generate the request we will check all our subnets that include the target IP and
#     will preserve the source address if it is from such subnet.
#     If there is no such subnet we select source address according to the rules for level 2.
# 2 - Always use the best local address for this target. In this mode we ignore the source address in the IP packet
#     and try to select local address that we prefer for talks with the target host.
#     Such local address is selected by looking for primary IP addresses on all our subnets on the outgoing interface
#     that include the target IP address. If no suitable local address is found we select the first local address
#     we have on the outgoing interface or on all other interfaces, with the hope we will receive reply for our
#     request and even sometimes no matter the source IP address we announce.
# The max value from conf/{all,interface}/arp_announce is used.
# Increasing the restriction level gives more chance for receiving answer from the resolved target
# while decreasing the level announces more valid sender's information

# 0 - (default): reply for any local target IP address, configured on any interface
# 1 - reply only if the target IP address is local address configured on the incoming interface
# 2 - reply only if the target IP address is local address configured on the incoming interface and both with the sender.s IP address
#     are part from same subnet on this interface
# 3 - do not reply for local addresses configured with scope host, only resolutions for global and link addresses are replied
# 4-7 - reserved
# 8 - do not reply for all local addresses
